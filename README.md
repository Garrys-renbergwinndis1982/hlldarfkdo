OMG, so I just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Phule and, honestly, my brain is still trying to process it. Like, I swear I’m not even sure what I just witnessed. I mean, have you seen the plot twists? One minute you’re like, yeah, I got this, then bam, total chaos. It’s like I 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   thinking it’d be a chill 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩, but now I’m questioning my life choices 😂.

The characters, oof, man! Some of them are seriously just wild cards. That lead actor though, his expressions are like meme-worthy gold, I’m tellin' ya. But seriously, did the dialogues hit you too? It’s almost like they sometimes forgot they had a script lol. Almost felt like improv, ya know?

> And the ending... can we just take a minute here? I don't even know how they expect us to wrap our heads around that. Like, was it genius or just plain confusing? I'm honestly still not sure. I was vibing with it, but at the same time could’ve done with a bit more clarity, you know? Maybe I should give it another 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩, or do you think that’s just asking for more confusion? 😂

Also, that soundtrack was, like, all over the place and totally added to the chaos. But in a weirdly good way? It’s like part of me wants to see if someone made a playlist already because my brain's still humming those random tunes. The 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮’s vibe... it almost feels like it was made to mess with our heads. Is there an art in making  s that unhinge you a bit? Coz that director nailed it. 🤯

By the way, I gotta say, sometimes while 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨, I was just like, dude, why am I doing this to myself. But then, curiosity wins, and you can’t look away, you get me? It's like the  's this weird rollercoaster, and you gotta see it through till the end if only to make sense of it all. Or attempt to, 'cause I don't even know anymore, haha.

definitely_needs_a_re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 = True

But, yeah, that was me ranting post-Phule—sorry if it's a bit all over the place. Just had to air out some thoughts. Anyway, lemme know what you think if you decide to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . We need to have a proper debriefing session. Catch ya in DMs soon. 🤙
